# cookie-parser-io

cookies parser for socket.io inspired by cookie-parser

Parse `Cookie` header and populate `req.cookies` with an object keyed by the cookie
names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a `secret` string,
which assigns `req.secret` so it may be used by other middleware.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install cookie-parser-io
```

## API

```js
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser-io')
```

### cookieParser(secret, options)

- `secret` a string used for signing cookies. This is optional and if not specified, will not parse signed cookies.
- `options` an object that is passed to `cookie.parse` as the second option. See [cookie](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cookie) for more information.
  - `decode` a function to decode the value of the cookie
ned cookie and the signature is valid, the key will be deleted from the object and added to the new object that is returned.

## Example

```js
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser-io');

var io = require('socket.io').listen(server);
io.use(cookieParserIO('secret word'));
io.on('connection', ...);
```
//retrieve cookies like this
var id = socket.request.signedCookies.uid;
var token = socket.request.signedCookies.auth_token;
